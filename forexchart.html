                                    <p class="text-dark">There is no one ‘best’ chart pattern, because they are all used to highlight different trends in a huge variety of markets. Often, chart patterns are used in candlestick trading, which makes it slightly easier to see the previous opens and closes of the market.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Some patterns are more suited to a volatile market, while others are less so. Some patterns are best used in a bullish market, and others are best used when a market is bearish.
                                        <br><br>
                                        That being said, it is important to know the ‘best’ chart pattern for your particular market, as using the wrong one or not knowing which one to use may cause you to miss out on an opportunity to profit.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Before getting into the intricacies of different chart patterns, it is important that we briefly explain support and resistance levels. Support refers to the level at which an asset’s price stops falling and bounces back up. Resistance is where the price usually stops rising and dips back down.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The reason levels of support and resistance appear is because of the balance between buyers and sellers – or demand and supply. When there are more buyers than sellers in a market (or more demand than supply), the price tends to rise. When there are more sellers than buyers (more supply than demand), the price usually falls.
                                        <br><br>
                                        As an example, an asset’s price might be rising because demand is outstripping supply. However, the price will eventually reach the maximum that buyers are willing to pay, and demand will decrease at that price level. At this point, buyers might decide to close their positions.
                                        <br><br>
                                        This creates resistance, and the price starts to fall toward a level of support as supply begins to outstrip demand as more and more buyers close their positions. Once an asset’s price falls enough, buyers might buy back into the market because the price is now more acceptable – creating a level of support where supply and demand begin to equal out.
                                        <br><br>
                                        If the increased buying continues, it will drive the price back up towards a level of resistance as demand begins to increase relative to supply. Once a price breaks through a level of resistance, it may become a level of support.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <h2>Types of chart patterns</h2>
                                        Chart patterns fall broadly into three categories: continuation patterns, reversal patterns and bilateral patterns.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                A continuation signals that an ongoing trend will continue
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Reversal chart patterns indicate that a trend may be about to change direction</li>
                                            <li>Bilateral chart patterns let traders know that the price could move either way – meaning the market is highly volatile</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>
                                        For all of these patterns, you can take a position with CFDs. This is because CFDs enable you to go short as well as long – meaning you can speculate on markets falling as well as rising. You may wish to go short during a bearish reversal or continuation, or long during a bullish reversal or continuation – whether you do so depends on the pattern and the market analysis that you have carried out.</p>
                                        <br><br>
                                        The most important thing to remember when using chart patterns as part of your technical analysis, is that they are not a guarantee that a market will move in that predicted direction – they are merely an indication of what might happen to an asset’s price.

                                    <p>Head and shoulders is a chart pattern in which a large peak has a slightly smaller peak on either side of it. Traders look at head and shoulders patterns to predict a bullish-to-bearish reversal.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Typically, the first and third peak will be smaller than the second, but they will all fall back to the same level of support, otherwise known as the ‘neckline’. Once the third peak has fallen back to the level of support, it is likely that it will breakout into a bearish downtrend.</p>

                                    <p>A double top is another pattern that traders use to highlight trend reversals.

                                    <p>A double bottom chart pattern indicates a period of selling, causing an asset’s price to drop below a level of support.

                                        A double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern, because it signifies the end of a downtrend and a shift towards an uptrend.</p>

                                        Following the rounding bottom, the price of an asset will likely enter a temporary retracement, which is known as the handle because this retracement is confined to two parallel lines on the price graph.

                                        A rising wedge is represented by a trend line caught between two upwardly slanted lines of support and resistance. In this case the line of support is steeper than the resistance line. This pattern generally signals that an asset’s price will eventually decline more permanently – which is demonstrated when it breaks through the support level.

In this respect, pennants can be a form of bilateral pattern because they show either continuations or reversals.

                                        While a pennant may seem similar to a wedge pattern or a triangle pattern – explained in the next sections – it is important to note that wedges are narrower than pennants or triangles. Also, wedges differ from pennants because a wedge is always ascending or descending, while a pennant is always horizontal.</p>

                                    <p>However, if there is no clear trend before the triangle pattern forms, the market could break out in either direction. This makes symmetrical triangles a bilateral pattern – meaning they are best used in volatile markets where there is no clear indication of which way an asset’s price might move. An example of a bilateral symmetrical triangle can be seen below.</p>

                                    <p>All of the patterns explained in this article are useful technical indicators which can help you to understand how or why an asset’s price moved in a certain way – and which way it might move in the future. This is because chart patterns are capable of highlighting areas of support and resistance, which can help a trader decide whether they should open a long or short position; or whether they should close out their open positions in the event of a possible trend reversal.</p>
