                                    In the trading world algo trading is also called algo-trading, automated trading, or
                                    even black-box trading. It is a computer program that follows a set of instructions
                                    for placing a trade. This type of trading can be profitable at a speed and frequency
                                    beyond the reach of a human trader.
                                    <br>
                                    Algo-traders can make thousands of trades per second, so if an algorithm is set
                                    right, it might become potentially a very powerful tool.
                                    <br>
                                    A study in 2019 showed that around 92% of trading in the Forex market was performed
                                    by trading algorithms rather than humans.

                                        <b>Index Fund Rebalancing</b> - Rebalancing is a process where the underlying assets
                                    of funds are readjusted according to current market conditions. For example, a
                                    pension fund is supposed to be a combination of 50% stocks and 50% bonds. In a few
                                    years the value of stocks increases, and now compromises 75% of the portfolio.
                                    During rebalancing, some of the stocks are sold, in order to bring back the
                                    portfolio to the original 50-50 allocation, and the trader profits. These
                                    rebalancing transactions are now automatized by algorithms.
                                    </li>
                                   <li> <b>High frequency arbitrage </b>- buying a dual-listed stock at a lower price in one
                                    market and simultaneously selling it at a higher price in another market offers the
                                    price differential as risk-free profit or arbitrage. Same can be done for stocks vs.
                                    futures instruments. Implementing an algorithm to identify such price differentials
                                    and placing the orders efficiently allows profitable opportunities.
                                </li>
                                    <li><b>Trading Range (Mean Reversion)</b> - strategy is based on the concept that the
                                        high and low prices of an asset are a temporary phenomenon and they will revert to
                                        their mean value (average value) periodically. Identifying and defining a price
                                        range and implementing an algorithm based on it allows trades to be placed
                                        automatically when the price of an asset breaks in and out of its defined
                                        range.</li>
                                    <li><b>Trend-following Strategies</b> - one of the most common algo trading strategies
                                        to follow trends in moving averages, channel breakouts, price level movements, and
                                        related technical indicators. These are the easiest and simplest strategies to
                                        implement through algo trading because these strategies do not involve making any
                                        predictions or price forecasts. Trading is initiated as soon as the desired trends
                                        appear, which are easy and simple to implement using algorithms, without going into
                                        the complexity of predictive analysis. Using 50- and 200-day moving averages is a
                                        popular trend following strategy.</li>
                                    <li><b>Mathematical Model-based Strategies</b> - Proven mathematical models, allow
                                        trading on a combination of options and the underlying security. Delta neutral
                                        (mathematical model) is a portfolio strategy consisting of multiple positions with
                                        offsetting positive and negative deltas—a ratio comparing the change in the price of
                                        an asset, usually a marketable security, to the corresponding change in the price of
                                        its derivative—so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals
                                        zero.</li>
                                    <li><b>Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP)</b> - the aim of this strategy is to execute
                                        the order close to the average price between the start and end times thereby
                                        minimizing market impact. Time-weighted average price strategy breaks up a large
                                        order and releases smaller chunks of the order to the market using evenly divided
                                        time slots between a start and end time.</li>
                                    <li><b>Volume-weighted Average Price (VWAP)</b> - The idea behind this strategy is
                                        somewhat the same as the Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP)- volume-weighted average
                                        price strategy breaks up a large order and releases smaller chunks of the order to
                                        the market using stock-specific historical volume profiles. The goal is to execute
                                        the order close to the volume-weighted average price (VWAP).</li>
                                    <li><b>Percentage of Volume (POV)</b> - until a trade order is fully executed, this
                                        algorithm continues to send partial orders according to a certain participation rate
                                        and according to the trading volume in the markets. This strategy submits orders,
                                        based on the user-defined percentage and increases or decreases this participation
                                        rate when the stock price reaches levels the trader has set.</li>
                                   <li> <b>Implementation Shortfall</b> - This strategy's goal is to minimize the execution
                                    cost of an order by trading off the real-time market, which helps saving on the cost
                                    of the order and benefiting from the opportunity cost of delayed execution. The
                                    strategy will increase the targeted participation rate when the stock price moves
                                    favorably and decrease it when the stock price moves adversely.</li>

                                <h2>Benefits of algo Trading</h2>
                                <p>The main reasons algo trading has become so popular are because of its
                                    advantages in speed, accuracy and lower cost compared to manual trading.</p>
                                <ul class="ul-tick">
                                    <li>Speed is one of the advantages of algo-trading. Trades are being executed
                                        automatically and with great speed, since they are planted and written
                                        beforehand.</li>
                                    <li>Quantity of indicators - trading with algorithms has the advantage of scanning
                                        and executing on multiple indicators at a speed that no human could do - trades
                                        can be analyzed and executed faster, hence more opportunities are available at
                                        better prices.</li>
                                    <li> Accuracy - computer automatically executing trades, which does rule out human
                                        error. For instance buying the wrong currency pair, or for the wrong amount.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Emotions are not going to stand in the way of rational decisions, thankfully
                                        everything is already automated and algorithm is running its course.</li>
                                    <li>Ability to backtest - With algo trading, traders can run the algorithms based on
                                        past data to see if it would've worked in the past. It lets the user remove any
                                        flaws of a trading system before trying it out live.</li>
                                    <li>Reduced transaction costs - with algo-trading traders don’t have to spend so
                                        much time analysing and monitoring markets.</li>
                                </ul>
