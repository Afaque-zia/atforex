                                <p> Forex technical analysis is the study of market action primarily through the use of
                                    charts for the
                                    purpose of forecasting future price trends. Forex traders can develop strategies
                                    based on various
                                    technical analysis tools including market trend, volume, range,support and
                                    resistance levels, chart
                                    patterns and indicators, as well as conduct a Multiple Time Frame Analysis using
                                    different timeframe charts.

                                    Technical analysis strategy is a crucial method of evaluating assets based on the
                                    analysis and
                                    statistics of past market action, such as past prices and past volume. The main goal
                                    of technical
                                    analysts is not the measuring of asset’s underlying value, they attempt to use

                                    Trend represents one of the most essential concepts in technical analysis. All the
                                    technical analy- sis tools that an analyst uses have a single purpose: help to
                                    identify the market trend.The meaning of Forex trend is not so much different from
                                    its general meaning - it is nothing more than the direction in which the market
                                    moves. But more precisely, foreign exchange market does not move in a straight line,
                                    its moves are characterized by a series of zigzags which resemble successive waves
                                    with clear peaks and troughs or highs and lows, as they are often called.

                                    depending on the movement of those peaks and troughs one can understand the
                                    trend’s
                                    type on the market.

                                <p class="pb-50">Traders and investors confront three types of decisions: go long, i.e.
                                    to buy, go

                                <p>In order to completely understand the essence of support and resistance trading
                                    strategy you should firstly know what a horizontal level is. Actually, it is a price
                                    level indicating either a support or resistance in the market. The support and
                                    resistance in technical analysis are the terms for price lows and highs
                                    respectively. The term support indicates the area on the chart where the buying
                                    interest is significantly strong and surpasses the selling pressure. It is usually
                                    marked by previous troughs. Resistance level,contrary to the support level,
                                    represents an area on the chart where sell- ing interest overcomes buying pressure.
                                    It is usually marked by previous peaks.
                                </p>

                                <i><b>Note: </b>In order to develop a support and resistance strategy you should be well
                                    aware of how the trend is identified through these horizontal levels. Thus, for an
                                    uptrend to go on, each successive support level should be higher than the previous
                                    one, and each successive resistance level should be higher than the one preceding
                                    it.
                                </i>
                                <p>In case this is not so, for instance, if the support level comes down to the previous
                                    trough, it may signify that the uptrend is coming to the end or at least it is
                                    turning into a sideways trend. It is likely that trend reversal from up to down will
                                    occur. The opposite situation takes place in a downtrend; the failure of each
                                    support level to move lower than the previous trough may again signal changes in the
                                    existing trend.

                                    The concept behind support and resistance trading is still the same - buying a
                                    security when we expect it to increase in price and sell when expecting its price to
                                    go down. Thus, when the price falls to the support level, traders decide to buy
                                    creating demand and driving the price up. In the same way, when the price rises to a
                                    resistance level, traders decide to sell, creating a downward pressure and driving
                                    the price down.

                                <p>Range trading strategy, which is also called channel trading, is generally associated
                                    with the lack of market direction and it is used during the absence of a trend.
                                    Range trading identifies currency price movement in channels and the first task of
                                    this strategy is to find the range. This process can be carried out by connecting a
                                    series of highs and lows with a horizontal trendline. In other words, the trader
                                    should find the major support and resistance levels with the area in between known
                                    as “trading range”.

                                <i><b>Note: </b>In range trading it’s quite easy to find the areas to take profit. You
                                    can buy at support and sell at resistance as long as the security hasn’t broken out
                                    of the channel. Otherwise, if the breakout direction is not favorable for your
                                    position, you may undergo huge losses.

                                </i>
                                <p class="tb-20">Range trading actually works in a market with just enough volatility
                                    due to which the price goes on wiggling in the channel without breaking out of the
                                    range. In the case the level of support and resistance breaks you should exit
                                    range-based positions. The most efficient way of managing this type of risk is the
                                    use of stop and limit orders as most traders do. They place stop limit orders when
                                    the currency price keeps dropping below the entry point and set the limit order to
                                    make profit when the security moves to the top of the range. In other words, while
                                    selling a range you should set limit orders down near the support level to take
                                    profit and while buying, you should place take profit or- ders at the previously
                                    defined resistance level.

                                <p>Since a security price meanwhile moves through multiple time frames it’s very useful
                                    for traders to analyze various time frames while determining the “trading circle” of
                                    the security. Through the Mul- tiple Time Frame Analysis (MTFA) you can determine
                                    the trend both on smaller and bigger scales and identify the overall market trend.
                                    The whole process of MTFA starts with the exact identification of the market
                                    direction on higher time frames (long, short or intermediary) and analyzing it
                                    through lower time frames starting from a 5-minute chart.

                                    trends are moving in the same direction. However, this may cause problems because
                                    time frames don’t always align and different kind of trends take place on different

                                    This chapter shows you how you can jump on a trend when the trend is the most
                                    robust, rather than when it is about to end. This way you can ride a trend with a

                                    Many false breakouts occur in forex price charts, and the occurrence of these
                                    fakeouts provides the perfect opportunity for fading breakouts, that is, trading
                                    against those breakouts. In this chapter, I explain why most breakouts fail, and how

                                    profits could potentially be captured in the least amount of time. The main problem
                                    with trading breakouts is that many of these breakout attempts fail. In this chapter

                                    This is a fundamental trading strategy that is highly favoured by institutional
                                    investors. In this chapter, I explain how a carry trade works, and highlight some
                                    points which you should keep in mind when adopting this strategy in the forex
                                    market.
